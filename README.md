#Invisible CMS
InvisibleCMS is a lightweight and open source content management system created by Francesco Zaffaroni ( @fzaffa ).

It is still in early development but it already works, anyway I recommend not to use it for production due to security issues.

##Instructions
To install and use it you only need to copy the files in a folder on your webserver, import in the database the included SQL, edit the *conn.php* file with your MySQL credentials and go to /yoursite/admin, there you will be able to create new pages and manage existing ones.

Be sure to insert in the template name field a name of an existing template without the *.php*, for example *home* will point to *home.php*
