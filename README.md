#Invisible CMS
InvisibleCMS is a lightweight and open source content management system created by Francesco @fzaffa Zaffaroni.

Basically I'm building this CMS as a practice to get better at PHP programming. I'm trying to keep this clean and to write everything on my own looking at the source code of different frameworks to better understand how they work under the hood.

The CMS per se is really simple: An admin interface from which you can create pages. Every page has a main body and may have different sections. Sections must be printed in the template to be made visible.

One of the goal for this is to keep the "framework", or the portion of the code that could actually be reused for something completely different, completely split from the actual application and its domain objects.
I'm also trying to keep the components not dependent from each other, and I might in the end try to create a composer package just to get my hands dirty.

If you have kept reading till here, well, thank you for the attention and if you have any suggestion or want to shoot me a message just use twitter: @fzaffa or here on GitHub.

Bye.
